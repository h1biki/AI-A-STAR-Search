# AI-A-STAR-Search

## The Problem:
Consider a grid of size N x N that represents a topographic map. Each tile describes the characteristics of its terrain, which could be of two types: normal or mountainous. ROBBIE the robot must navigate from a starting position (xs,ys) to a goal position(xg,yg) using a learned algorithms (there can only be one start and one goal).
Note: In the explanations below, we assume that tile (1,1) is the top-left tile in the map.

ROBBIEâ€™s wheels are built so that a diagonal move is the easiest. Hence, the cost of
such a move is 1. Any other move has a cost of 2.

## Solution
Using A* search, the heuristic value is generated by calculating the airline distance
and the heuristic value is within the actual cost and never overestimated(admissibility of A*).
Tie breaking, first found first, to prevent loop.
Tree search:
If the frontier is empty then return NO-PATH.
Choose a child to move and remove it from frontier.
If goal found then traceback to start and print the solution.
Expand the chosen one, add possible movements to frontiers.
