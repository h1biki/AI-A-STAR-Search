# AI-A-STAR-Search

Using A* search, the heuristic value is generated by calculating the airline distance
and the heuristic value is within the actual cost and never overestimated(admissibility of A*).
Tie breaking, first found first, to prevent loop.
Tree search:
If the frontier is empty then return NO-PATH.
Choose a child to move and remove it from frontier.
If goal found then traceback to start and print the solution.
Expand the chosen one, add possible movements to frontiers.
